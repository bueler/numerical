## Codes

There are a few codes provided by the authors of the textbook.  Go to

[lifeislinear.davidson.edu/numerical/matlab.html](https://lifeislinear.davidson.edu/numerical/matlab.html)

The Matlab/Octave codes below come from examples I did in lecture, or they are from the Homework solutions.  For the full Homework solutions go to the [Canvas course page](https://canvas.alaska.edu/courses/21626).
