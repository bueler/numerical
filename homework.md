## Homework Assignments

Each homework Assignment has its own PDF.  The links below are in reverse chronological order.  The [Schedule](assets/general/S24/schedule.pdf) also shows the due dates.

Assignments are **due at the start of class**.  Please turn in each Assignment on paper, stapled in the upper-left corner, and with your name on the upper-right corner.  Please clearly indicate the assignment number in the title, and clearly indicate the beginning of each exercise/problem.

After each Assignment is due, complete solutions will be posted at the **Modules tab** of the [Canvas course page] FIXME.
